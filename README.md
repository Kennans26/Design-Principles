## Introduction

Software design is a crucial aspect of writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code. This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing SOLID principles and other design principles to enhance the quality of your software.

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class should have only one reason to change.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be able to replace objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. 

## Design Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code to promote maintainability and reduce errors.

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Simplicity should be a key goal in design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Only implement features when they are needed, not based on anticipated future requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have examples, explanations, or improvements related to SOLID principles or design principles, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
